# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

For this project, I was tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database in order to accomplish this goal. This challenge was especially difficult for me because my weakness so far in the boot camp has been creating and testing routes with Insomnia. The application isn't perfect yet, but it does fulfill the User Story and the 
challenge requirements.

*The E-Commerce business wasn't all it's cracked up to be.* 
*We're really pinching pennies over here. We don't even have a store. Everything just sits on a chair next to my bed. And every morning, I have to wake up and look at that pile, knowing full well we haven't sold anything in weeks.  I'll be straight with you -- I wouldn't buy them. I  really wouldn't. But here we are. I mean, I took out a mortgage on my house for this. Now I'm clearing out the nice, ceramic plates from my kitchen cabinets to fit all the extra cargo shorts I ordered. Why did I ever think starting a business in my studio apartment was a good idea? Maybe this is what Marlene was talking about when she left.*
